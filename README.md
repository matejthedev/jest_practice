# Jest Tests for `add` and `toUpperReverse` Functions

This repository contains Jest tests for two JavaScript functions: `add` and `toUpperReverse`.

## Jest Testing Structure

Jest tests are organized using the `describe` and `it` functions. The `describe` function is used to group tests together and provide a descriptive label for the group of tests. The `it` function is used to specify individual test cases, and takes a string argument that describes the test case, followed by a callback function that contains the test assertions.
